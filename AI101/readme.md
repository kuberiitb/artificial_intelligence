If you are new to the world of AI and know just basic python, this tutorial is for you.

It will help you taking baby steps.
You will learn
- How to use an LLM to solve a problem
- How to write basic prompt
- How to get desired output
- How to evaluate the output from LLM

1. Do the setup [00_setup.md](AI101/00_setup.md)

2. Test your key here [01_test_grok_api_key.ipynb](AI101/01_test_grok_api_key.ipynb)
  
3. Try your first prompt engineering task [02_sentimet_analysis_ner_example.ipynb](AI101/02_sentimet_analysis_ner_example_prompt_engineering.ipynb)
   
4. Build LLM Judge using prompt engineering [03_tic_tac_toe_judge.ipynb](AI101/03_tic_tac_toe_judge_prompt_engineering.ipynb)
